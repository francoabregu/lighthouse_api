Drop the aXe on your accessibility defects!\n\nThanks for helping us to make axe-core the most widely used HTML accessibility testing library in the galaxy! Share your axe-core story using #axecoresquad or by submitting it [here](https://accessibility.deque.com/axe-core-stories) to get a sweet T-shirt.\n\n## Philosophy\n\nWe believe that automated testing has an important role to play in achieving digital equality and that in order to do that, it must achieve mainstream adoption by professional web developers. That means that the tests must inspire trust, must be fast, must work everywhere and must be available everywhere.\n\n## Manifesto\n\n1. Automated accessibility testing rules must have a zero false-positive rate\n2. Automated accessibility testing rules must be lightweight and fast\n3. Automated accessibility testing rules must work in all modern browsers\n4. Automated accessibility testing rules must, themselves, be tested automatically\n\n## The sharp edge of the aXe\n\naXe is the third generation of accessibility rules for HTML-based user interfaces that differentiates itself from other approaches and rules repositories in the following ways:\n\n1. It works on all modern browsers,\n2. It supports in-memory fixtures, static fixtures, integration tests and iframes of infinite depth\n3. It has zero false positives (bugs notwithstanding)\n4. It is open source\n5. It is actively supported by a major accessibility vendor\n6. It is designed to work with whatever tools, frameworks, libraries and environments you have today\n7. It is designed to be integrated into your existing functional/acceptance automated tests\n8. It automatically determines which rules to run based on the evaluation context\n9. It is highly configurable\n\n## Getting started\n\nFirst download the package:\n\n```\nnpm install axe-core --save-dev\n```\n\nNow include the javascript file in each of your iframes in your fixtures or test systems:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"node_modules/axe-core/axe.min.js\" ></script>\n```\n\nNow insert calls at each point in your tests where a new piece of UI becomes visible or exposed:\n\n```js\naxe.run(function (err, results) {\n\tif (err) throw err;\n    ok(results.violations.length === 0, 'Should be no accessibility issues');\n    // complete the async call\n    ...\n});\n```\n## Supported Browsers\n\nThe [aXe API](doc/API.md) supports the following browsers:\n\n* Internet Explorer v9, 10, 11\n* Google Chrome v42 and above\n* Mozilla Firefox v38 and above\n* Apple Safari v7 and above\n\n## The Accessibility Rules\n\nThe complete list of rules run by axe-core can be found in [doc/rule-descriptions.md](./doc/rule-descriptions.md).\n\n## Contents of the API Package\n\nThe [aXe API](doc/API.md) package consists of:\n\n* `axe.js` - the JavaScript file that should be included in your web site under test (API)\n* `axe.min.js` - a minified version of the above file\n\n## Localization\n\nAxe can be built using your local language. To do so, a localization file must be added to the `./locales` directory. This file must have be named in the following manner: `<langcode>.json`. To build aXe using this locale, instead of the default, run aXe with the `--lang` flag, like so:\n\n`grunt build --lang=nl`\n\nThis will create a new build for aXe, called `axe.<lang>.js` and `axe.<lang>.min.js`. If you want to build localized versions, simply pass in `--all-lang` instead.\n\nTo create a new translation for aXe, start by running `grunt translate --lang=<langcode>`. This will create a json file fin the `./locales` directory, with the default English text in it for you to translate. We welcome any localization for axe-core. For details on how to contribute, see the Contributing section below.\n\nTo update existing translation file, re-run `grunt translate --lang=<langcode>`. This will add new messages used in English and remove messages which were not used in English.\n\n## Contributing\n\nRead the [Proposing Axe-core Rules guide ](./doc/rule-proposal.md)\n\nRead the [documentation on the architecture](./doc/developer-guide.md)\n\nRead the [documentation on contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Projects using axe-core\n\n[List of projects using axe-core](doc/projects.md)\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Dulin Marat for his [css-selector-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-selector-parser) implementation which is included for shadow DOM support.\n\nThanks to the [Slick Parser](https://github.com/mootools/slick/blob/master/Source/Slick.Parser.js) implementers for their contribution, we have used some of their algorithms in our shadow DOM support code.\n",
